 The `funsearch` algorithm is an iterative process to iteratively improve the performance of a Python function guided by a language model like GPT-4. It involves several components that work together to sample, evaluate, and evolve functions towards better performance.
 

Step 1:
   Load configuration settings from a file and environmental variables.
   Set up logging to record every step to a logger file.
   Create a LLM Instance which will require Openai Keys. This class will be used to generate new programs using LLM.
   
Step 2: Spec Program:
   You will be provided with a Python module (`spec_file`) that contains two decorated functions: one with `@funsearch.evolve`, which is the function to be evolved and improved, and the other with `@funsearch.run`, which is the evaluation function that scores the solutions according to some criteria.
   Parse the above module to get names of function to evolve and function used to score.
   
Step 3: 
   Read the testcases for the `spec_file`,  which might be a file (JSON or pickle format) or comma-separated values.
   
Step 4:
   Create and initialize the `Program DataBase`. 
   An Instance of `Program database` is composed of N(derived from configuration) sub-populations called `islands`. Each `island` contains `clusters` associated with specific scores. All programs that receive the same score reside in the same `cluster` with in an `island`. Each `cluster` holds a list of programs and their corresponding string lengths.
   If a backup file is provided, 
	load the program database from this file to resume from a previous state.
   else 
	Program database and all clusters in it will be empty right now.
   
Step 5:
   Determine the type of sandboxing to use (e.g., a container sandbox for isolation, DummySandBox to execute in same Machine). And Initialize a Sandbox instance, which is later used to execute the generated python programs and obtain the results.

Step 6:
   Create and Initialize a list of predefined no.of Evaluators, Which will be used for testing Programs generated by LLM on each Test case, by using sandbox instance we created above.
   
Step 7:
    Randomly select an Evaluator we created in previous step. Evaluate the `spec_file` on all the test cases and obtain score.
    Once the Scores are available, Register this same program along with score to all clusters in all island.
    So the Program Database will be populated with initial Program if not loaded with previous state.
    
Step 8:
   Initialize sampler instance, that will operate to generate new sample programs continuously.
   
Step 9: Sampling a Prompt from Program Database.
   An island is randomly selected from the program database. 
   A set of clusters is chosen from the selected island based on probabilities derived from the cluster scores. 
   Selected clusters are those most likely to lead to improvements. Programs from the chosen clusters are selected, with a preference for shorter programs to encourage concise solutions.
   We sample k programs from a single island(different clusters) in the programs database, Sampled programs are then sorted according to their score, and a version is assigned to each (‘v0’ for the lowest scoring program, ‘v1’ for the second lowest scoring and so on.)
   
   
Step 10: Generate Programs:
   The constructed prompt is sent to the language model (GPT-4) to generate multiple samples (the body of `new version`) of the given prompt. 
   
Step 11: Evaluate the programs and Update Database:
   The generated programs are evaluated using the `Evaluator` class, which scores the function's performance on all test cases.
   The generated programs and its scores are registered back into the same island which we selected in previous step.
   Programs that were incorrect (that did not execute within the imposed time and memory limits, or produced invalid outputs) are discarded
   If the Scores are not present in this island, 
       Create a new cluster with this score and register these sample programs in the new cluster. 
   else 
       Update the cluster whose scores matches these sample scores, with the generated programs.
   
   If the generated program has a score that surpasses the best score of the island, the best score and program are updated accordingly.
   
   
Step 12:
   The database can be backed up periodically, and logs are kept for analysis and debugging. To maintain diversity and avoid premature convergence, weaker islands (those with the lowest scores) can be reset periodically, with the new founder programs sampled from better-performing islands.

Step 13:
    Steps 9 to 12 are looped for Some predefined iterations or untill a KeyBoard interrupt, This will continually sampling prompts, generating programs using the LLM, and evaluating the outputs, improving the function iteratively.
    
Step 14:
    If iterations are completed or Stopped by Keyboard Interrupt, Save the program database to a file and Print the programs with highest score.
    
    
This algorithm is a type of genetic algorithm, where each program sample is like an "individual" whose "fitness" is evaluated by how well it performs on the given task. The genetic material (program code) is evolved over generations (iterations) with the goal of finding an optimal or satisfactory solution to the mathematical problem at hand.
